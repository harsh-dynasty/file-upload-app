# file-upload-app

I have used react, node and mongoose with gridFS to store large files specifically videos as chunks in db
I have already build the react app and pasted all the static files in the public folder of the root directly
Steps to initialize app :

1. run : npm install
2. make .env file in the root directory and set property MONGO_URI=mongodb://any mongo url
3. run : node server.js
